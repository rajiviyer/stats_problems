What is your conclusion from this experiment?"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ncOcJQA9o9LP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1630004630332,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":422,"user":{"displayName":"Rajiv Iyer","photoUrl":"","userId":"11432028863084943526"}},"outputId":"6c7ad3c1-ce69-47ab-c8bb-1b600aac0bcc"},"source":["mean_diameter=0.2508\n","sd_diameter=0.0005\n","higher_spec=0.2500+0.0015\n","lower_spec=0.2500-0.0015\n","print(f\"Proportion of shafts in sync with specifications is : np.round(stats.norm.cdf(higher_spec,loc=mean_diameter,scale=sd_diameter)-stats.norm.cdf(lower_spec,loc=mean_diameter,scale=sd_diameter),3)\")\n","new_mean_diameter=0.2500\n","print(f\"Proportion of shafts in sync with specifications is : {np.round(stats.norm.cdf(higher_spec,loc=mean_diameter,scale=sd_diameter)-stats.norm.cdf(lower_spec,loc=mean_diameter,scale=sd_diameter),3)}\")\n","print(f\"Proportion of shafts centered around 0.2500 : ?????\")"],"execution_count":73,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Proportion of shafts in sync with specifications is : np.round(stats.norm.cdf(higher_spec,loc=mean_diameter,scale=sd_diameter)-stats.norm.cdf(lower_spec,loc=mean_diameter,scale=sd_diameter),3)\n","Proportion of shafts in sync with specifications is : 0.919\n","Proportion of shafts centered around 0.2500 : ?????\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"4dxa2e1N0hKj"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
